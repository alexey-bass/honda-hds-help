Unit Conversion Type: PRESSURE</p>
<p>The barometric pressure sensor is located inside the PCM. 
The sensor detects barometric pressure and converts it into voltage. The signal is 
used to correct injection time for changing altitude and atmospheric conditions. The voltage 
becomes lower as atmospheric pressure decreases, and the voltage becomes higher 
as atmospheric pressure increases. </p>
<p></p>
<p>There are two different sensors used, each having different voltage 
characteristics. The most widely used is shown as Type A in the graph below. 
It will typically read near 2.88 V at sea level. Type B was introduced on some 
models in 2008. It will typically read near 4.08 V at sea level. </p>

<p>NOTE: At times you may be requested to compare the MAP and BARO sensors to 
each other with the Key On Engine Off (KOEO). The voltage and pressure 
values on a Type A BARO and a MAP sensor should read near each other. The 
voltage value of a Type B BARO sensor will not read the same as the MAP 
sensor. If you change the unit conversion from voltage to pressure, the 
values should then be close to the same. </p>

<h3>PARAMETER SPECIFICATION</h3>
<p><br>
MAP SENSOR:<br>
Manifold Absolute Pressure Sensor<br>
(V)(kPa)(MPa)(kgf/cm<sup>2</sup>)(mmHg)(inHg)(psi)<br>
Unit Conversion Type: PRESSURE</p>
<p>- The sensor detects the intake manifold pressure, converts it into the 
voltage by the semiconductor, and sends it to the control unit. The signal is 
used for determination of the basic injection time together with the engine 
speed signal output from the crankshaft angle sensor.</p>
<p>- The manifold absolute pressure sensor is installed between the throttle 
valve of the throttle body and the intake manifold, and it detects the intake 
manifold vacuum to calculate intake air amount.</p>
<p>- The vacuum generated in the intake manifold is applied to the silicon 
diaphragm (sensor element). The silicon diaphragm is an element that changes the 
electric resistance value by the applied pressure. A voltage is pre-applied to 
the electrode provided in the diaphragm, and current value changes according to 
pressure change. This current change is converted into voltage change by the 
amplifier, and the sensor signal is output.</p>
<p>- The sensor signal operates the amplifier by the reference voltage (5V) 
supplied from the VCC. The amplifier generates a signal based on this voltage, 
and outputs it to the ECU.</p>
<p>- The voltage becomes lower with larger intake manifold vacuum, and the 
voltage becomes higher with smaller intake manifold vacuum. This change is in 
proportion to the vacuum generated in the intake manifold.</p>
<p>- With this vacuum signal, the computer calculates the amount of intake air 
based on the engine speed and throttle position.</p>
<p>- The manifold absolute pressure sensor detects the intake air density from 
the throttle valve position and engine load status change (high/low) from the 
intake air vacuum of the intake manifold.</p>
<p>- The manifold absolute pressure sensor has the unit structure with an 
amplifier, which is the amplifier circuit supplied the reference voltage from 
the ECU. The sensor detects intake air vacuum by the pressure sensor, amplifies 
it by the amplifier, and converts it into the signal voltage. The signal voltage 
is low at vacuum side, and high at atmosphere pressure side.</p>

<h3>PARAMETER SPECIFICATION</h3>
<p><br>
ECT SENSOR / ECT SENSOR 1 :<br>
Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor / Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor 1<br>
(°C) (°F) (V)<br>
Unit Conversion Type: TEMPERATURE</p>
<p>- The sensor detects the coolant temperature change via resistance value 
change of the thermistor, converts it into voltage, and sends it to the control 
unit. With this signal (voltage), the basic injection time is corrected 
according to the coolant temperature. The resistance value of the thermistor 
becomes higher with lower coolant temperature, and the value becomes lower with 
higher temperature.</p>
<p>- The engine coolant temperature sensor is a thermistor sensor installed to 
the block, and it detects engine coolant temperature.</p>
<p>- The thermistor changes its resistance value according to the temperature, 
and the resistance value change is in proportion to the temperature. Therefore, 
the thermistor is placed into the coolant, and the sensor detects the resistance 
value change and converts it to coolant temperature change.</p>
<p>- The resistance value change for the temperature (temperature resistance 
characteristics) is as shown in the figure. When the thermistor detects lower 
temperature, the resistance value becomes higher, and it detects higher 
temperature, the value becomes lower.</p>
<p>- The thermistor detects the resistance value as temperature, and the 
computer cannot detect the resistance value. Therefore, the value needs to be 
converted into the voltage value which can be detected by the computer.</p>
<p>- To convert into the voltage value, the voltage of 5V is output by the 
reference voltage circuit in the ECU, and applied it to the thermostat. The 
thermostat has a circuit that consumes a certain voltage out of the 5V depending 
on the resistance value, and current values in the circuit change resulting in 
voltage change.</p>
<p>- The voltage becomes higher (5V), as the temperature becomes lower, and it 
becomes lower, as the temperature becomes higher. Because this voltage change is 
in proportion to the resistance change, the temperature can be detected by the 
computer.</p>
<p>- The engine coolant temperature sensor is installed on the cylinder block, 
and it detects engine coolant temperature change. The engine coolant temperature 
sensor uses the thermostat that changes its resistance value according to the 
temperature. The resistance value becomes higher with lower coolant temperature, 
and it becomes lower with higher temperature. The signal voltage is output based 
on the resistance value change of the thermostat.</p>

<h3>PARAMETER SPECIFICATION</h3>
<p><br>
VEHICLE SPEED:<br>
Vehicle Speed<br>
(km/h) (MPH)<br>
Unit Conversion Type: VEHICLE SPEED</p>
<p>The vehicle speed (km/h) is converted by ECU from the pulse signal sent from 
the vehicle speed sensor for display. When the drive wheel speed is 2km/h or 
higher, the ECU controls various functions using the wheel speed information. 
Examples)<br>
ON/OFF control of V TEC system Fuel-cut control at high speed driving Control of 
air fuel ratio correction during driving.</p>
<p>- The vehicle speed sensor is also used for the speedometer. The pulse signal 
is output from the sensor based on the vehicle speed, and the vehicle speed 
(km/h) is calculated from the number of pulses within the specified time.</p>
<p>- The vehicle speed sensor system detects the differential gear rotation by 
the magnet integrated in the rotor and Hall element installed outside of the 
magnet. When voltage is applied to the Hall element and magnetic flux is 
changed, Hall voltage is output based on the magnetic flux change. Because the 
Hall voltage changes in four cycles during one rotor rotation, the waveform 
creation circuit outputs four-pulse signal.</p>
<p>- When the vehicle speed becomes higher, number of the vehicle speed signal 
pulse within the specified time increases, and voltage is output with 
approximately 7pulses/s at 10km/h, and 707pulses /s at 100km/h.</p>
<p>- The signal voltage output from the vehicle speed sensor is a pulse signal, 
and voltage of 0V and 5V is output alternately. When the vehicle speed sensor 
signal is OF, the voltage (5V) output from reference circuit of the computer in 
the ECU flows to the vehicle speed sensor and becomes 0V, and when the vehicle 
speed sensor signal is ON, the reference voltage becomes 5V at the same 
potential.</p>
<p>- The computer detects the vehicle speed signal based on ON/OFF switching of 
the reference voltage which is made by ON/OFF switching of the vehicle speed 
sensor. - The vehicle sensor detects the vehicle speed change based on final 
gear rotation speed on the transmission.</p>
<p>- The vehicle speed sensor has a magnetic sensing element and detects 
magnetic flux change. This change is amplified and converted into Hi and Lo 
voltage signals. The magnetic flux changes depending on the rotation speed of 
the magnetic rotor installed on rotation area of the final gear.</p>

LT FUEL TRIM:<br>
Long Term Fuel Trim<br>
(Counts)</p>
<p>Air fuel feedback average (AF FB AVE) is used by the PCM to detect long term failures in the air fuel control system.
 The fuel system is too rich when AF FB AVE drops below the lower limit threshold while the purge control solenoid is 
turned off. The fuel system is too lean when AF FB AVE rises above the upper limit threshold.</p>
<p>AF FB AVE generally chases AF FB, updating about once a minute. However AF FB AVE may remain much lower than AF FB
depending on the amount of fuel vapors stored in the EVAP canister. An AF FB AVE value near the lower limit threshold 
may be normal depending on the value of AF FB. </p>

<p>In the case of a saturated EVAP canister, AF FB may be reading normally but AF FB AVE will drop near or below the 
lower limit threshold. The PCM has logic to prevent a DTC from setting during this condition. The graph above shows the 
AF FB value reading normally and the AF FB AVE at the lower limit threshold. When this occurs, the PCM cuts purge 
operation and sees if AF FB AVE begins to return toward 1.00. If AF FB AVE increases above a certain threshold, 
the monitor is paused for a set time and purge is turned back on to remove excess purge vapor from the canister. 
The monitor is resumed after the set time expires. </p>

<h3>PARAMETER SPECIFICATION</h3>
<p><br>
INJECTOR:<br>
Injector</p>
(ms)</p>
<p>- This status indicates that the ECU transmits the determined injection amount 
to the injector.</p>
<p>- The ECU determines the optimum injection amount depending on the engine 
operating conditions using the signals from all the sensors, actuators, relays, 
and valves.</p>
<p>- The injector is a solenoid valve which supplies the optimum amount of fuel 
depending on the engine operating conditions. The pressure-adjusted fuel is 
supplied to the injector where it is measured and injected into the intake 
manifold with the minimum valve opening time. This enables the optimum fuel 
supply. In addition, as the engine operation range changes from idling to medium 
speed, and finally to the top speed, it requires the instantaneous measurement 
and injection depending on the situation. For this reason, the injector is a 
resistor-integrated type with improved response.</p>
<p>(1) Injector activation</p>
<p>- When the solenoid coil is energized, the magnetic flux generated on the 
coil energizes the core. Then the core is pulled and moves into the solenoid 
coil by overcoming the solenoid spring force. At this time, the needle valve 
also moves together with the core. This makes the needle valve and valve seat of 
the valve body separated and the fuel is injected. The measurement amount is 
calculated using the coil energization time and the pre-applied fuel pressure.</p>
<p>(2) Resistor operation</p>
<p>- The resistor improves the injector response. As the engine speed increases, 
the time-based energization count (ON/OFF) of the coil also increases. The 
increased alternative resistance prevents the current flowing smoothly. At this 
time, the injector functions to improve the response of the solenoid coil.</p>
<p>(3) Injector operation</p>
<p>- After the computer determines the operation time (injection time), the 
voltage signal transmitted from the main relay via the resistor injector to the 
drive circuit turns ON the drive circuit. The drive current flows to the 
solenoid coil of the injector to generate the operation waveform which controls 
the coil.</p>
<p>- The injector starts operation gradually when receiving the operation ON 
signal by the operation waveform generated on the coil. The operation time until 
the injector is completely operated (the valid operation time) is considered as 
the invalid operation time. The total operation time includes this invalid time.</p>
<p>- When the operation signal is turned OFF, the counter electromotive voltage 
rises rapidly on the coil. This risen voltage ensures that the injection 
properly completes.</p>
<p>- The injector is a solenoid valve which is required high opening/closing 
precision, response, endurance. It consists of plunger, needle valve, core, 
solenoid coil, filter, and valve.</p>
<p>- The fuel supplied via the inside of the injector is injected through the 
needle valve. The fuel lubricates and cools the injector to stabilize the 
temperature of the needle valve. The injection amount is adjusted by changing ON 
time of ON/OFF output signals synchronized with the engine speed signal.</p>
<p>&lt;Current flow&gt;</p>
<p>- The injector power is supplied from the battery via the main relay when the 
ignition is turned ON. The ground is made in the ECU to activate the injector.</p>
<p>&lt;Operation&gt;</p>
<p>1. After the ECU determines the injection time, the fuel injector is 
energized.</p>
<p>2. This energizes the solenoid coil to pull the core.</p>
<p>3. Because the needle valve and plunger are integrated with the core, the 
needle valve lifts.</p>
<p>4. The inside of the injector is filled with the pressurized fuel. When the 
needle valve lifts, the fuel is injected through the tip of the injector.</p>
<p>5. The lift amount of the injector needle valve is set to the specified 
amount, and the fuel pressure is maintained at the specific value by the 
pressure regulator. Therefore, the injection amount is determined by the valve 
opening time (energization time of the solenoid valve).</p>
<p>- Reference operating range (idle) 1.5ms - 3.5ms</p>

<p>This is diagnostic result information about Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) Insufficient Flow (P0401).<br>
This is the ratio of current EGR flow to pre-determined normal EGR flow. <br>
(EGR FLOW OPEN RATIO) = (Current EGR Flow) / (Pre-determined Normal EGR Flow)</p>
<ul>
<li>"Current EGR Flow" is calculated from intake manifold pressure (i.e. MAP) between when the EGR valve is fully opened and when it is fully closed under the monitor of P0401.<br>
(Current EGR Flow) = (MAP when the EGR valve is fully opened)-(MAP when the EGR valve is fully closed)</li>
<li>"Pre-determined Normal EGR Flow" is the basic intake manifold pressure (i.e. MAP) between when the EGR valve is fully opened and when it is fully closed EGR if there is EGR passage clogged. It is determined from the table in ECU program when "Current EGR Flow" is calculated because it shall be different by vehicle condition and environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>When this parameter shows 100%, it means this system is normal and there is no EGR passage clogged. If this parameter is malfunction threshold or less, system will be malfunction and EGR passage is clogged.<br>
Then P0401shall be occurred. The malfunction threshold is different by each model. Refer to "Advanced Diagnostic" information for each model.<br> 
For Example: Regards to 12MY FIT AT, the threshold is 20%.</p>

<p>Moreover, Enable condition of P0401 is different between each model. Refer to "Advanced Diagnostics" for each model.<br>
General Description: The EGR valve is closed during deceleration with the throttle valve fully closed. Then the ECM/PCM fully opens the EGR valve. After a set time, the ECM/PCM computes the ratio of the present EGR flow to the normal EGR flow by monitoring the fluctuation of the intake manifold pressure between when the EGR valve is fully opened and when it is fully closed. Then, ECM/PCM diagnoses P0401.</p>

<p>- The EGR control reduces NOX in the exhaust gas. It recirculates the exhaust

<p>(1) Activation</p>
<p>- When the computer determines the recirculation amount of EGR, the EGR

the valve position. The voltage changes in proportion to the valve position. 
Therefore, when the valve position calculated by the computer is not obtained, 
the EGR control SOL V is activated to obtain it.</p>
<p>- The drive signal (ES) of the EGR control SOL V is the duty signal. When the 
ON time is long, the vacuum inflow amount applied to the diaphragm of the EGR 
valve increases, and the lift amount of the EGR valve also increases.</p>
<p>- The exhaust gas recirculation unit has the EGR valve with the valve position sensor. 
It feedbacks the actual lift amount to the ECU to compare it with the target 
lift amount in order to improve fuel economy and engine performance, and to 
reduce NOX level.</p>
<p>The EGR valve is operated by the mixture vacuum, which consists of the vacuum 
that is controlled to the fixed value by the vacuum control valve, and the 
secondary air that is taken through the EGR control solenoid valve. In each 
operation range when the engine is cold, at idling, high speed, high load, and 
deceleration, the EGR operation is cancelled to secure the engine performance.</p>
<p>&lt;Operation&gt; In the EGR operation range, when the ECU receives the signals 
from the sensors, it opens/closes the EGR control solenoid valve to obtain the 
memorized target lift amount, and controls the CLOSE time (duty time). When the 
EGR valve opens (lifts), the valve position sensor detects the opening amount (lift 
amount), and it is sent to the ECU. Based on this signal, the ECU controls the 
EGR valve to obtain the target lift amount.</p>
<p>- Reference operating range (no lift) 0.95V - 1.50V</p>

<li>Acceleration by combustion toque is weak when this parameter closes to 0.</li>
<li>Acceleration by combustion toque is strong when this parameter becomes large. Especially, this parameter will show large value when cranking, idling (i.e. low engine speed and unstable engine state) etc.</li>
</ul>
On the other hand, when misfire is happened, engine speed of the cylinder is lower than average because of no combustion torque. Then, this parameter will be negative value, and show -8 rad/s or near.<br>
<br>NOTE: minimum value of this parameter is -8 rad/s, so this parameter may continue to show -8 rad/s when misfire is happened.</p>
<p><br>
<u>How to use this parameter</u>:<br>
<ol>
<li>Please check this value whether positive or negative. If it is negative value, misfire is happened in the cylinder.</li>
<li>Please compare the value with other cylinders. If this value is pretty smaller than other cylinder's one, abnormal combustion is happened in the cylinder. Then, please diagnose possible failures of misfire. <br>
For example: poor injection flow, poor valve clearance, poor air flow etc</li>
<li>Please compare the value with other cylinders. If this value is pretty larger than other cylinder's one, combustion pressure is shortage.<br>
For example: compression leak etc</li></ol></p>
